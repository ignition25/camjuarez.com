=============
Hello, I'm Cam Juarez and this is the repository for my [blog's](http://camjuarez.com) source code. Feel free to browse and check
out the code, if you have any questions I can usually be reached via twitter @[camjuarez](http://twitter.com/camjuarez)

## How It's Implemented
I'm using Ruby on Rails paired with [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) to allow for an admin CRUD (Create, Read,
Update, Delete) interface for posts. The posts are written in textile markup using [RedCloth](http://redcloth.org/).

## Deployment
I've opted to deploy via [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/) mostly out of convinience.
